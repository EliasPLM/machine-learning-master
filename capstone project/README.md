# This Capstone Project
This project is a three-step project some contains three files balancing_dataset.ipynb, xray_cnn_model.ipynb and benchmark_model.ipynb for balancing the data and the final model and benchmark model.
<br>
<br>
the first file balancing_dataset.ipynb is used to make a new balanced data set from the original data set there can be found in the link below.
<br>
<br>
the second xray_cnn_model.ipynb file contains the final neural network for this project and the third file contains the benchmark model for my proposal.
<br>
<br>
all information about this project can be found in the proposel.pdf and report.pdf.

# Instructions
1.) download the data set and paste it into the top directory: "capstone project".
<br>
2.) run balancing_dataset.ipynb file with Jupyter notebook for creating the new balance data set. Make sure only to run the file one time.
<br>
3.) run xray_cnn_model.ipynb with Jupyter notebook for using the neural network and see the prefroms of it.
    alternatively compile the model and run model.load_weights function in line[17] in the xray_cnn_model.ipynb file for using the existing weights for this project.
<br> 
4.) run the benchmark_model.ipynb to see the result of the been mark model
    alternatively compile the model and run model.load_weights function in line[6] in the benchmark_model.ipynb file for using the existing weights for this project.
