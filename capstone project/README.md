# This Capstone Project
This project is a two-step project some contains two files balanced_data.ipynb and X_ray_CNN.ipynb for running the neural network
the first file balanced_data.ipynb are used to make a new data set with from the original data set there can be found in the link below.
the second file contains the neural network for this project and all benchmark test.

# Instructions
1.) download the data set and paste it into the top directory: "capstone project".
<br>
2.) run balanced_data.ipynb file with Jupyter notebook for creating the new balance data set. Make sure only to run the file one time.
<br>
3.) run X_ray_CNN.ipynb with Jupyter notebook for using the neural network and benchmark tests.
    alternatively compile the model and run model.load_weights in line[17] in the X_ray_CNN.ipynb for using the existing weights for this project.
